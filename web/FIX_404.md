# Fix 404 Error After Sign In - Quick Steps 🔧

I've fixed the redirect issue. Now follow these steps:

## Step 1: Restart Dev Server (IMPORTANT!)

1. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
2. **Clear cache** (already done, but do this to be sure):
   ```bash
   cd web
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```
3. **Start fresh**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Wait** for "Ready on http://localhost:3000"

## Step 2: Test Sign In

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. **Sign in** with your email and password
3. **After sign in**, you should be redirected to `/app/nearby` (not `/app`)

## What I Fixed

- Changed redirect from `/app` to `/app/nearby` (direct route)
- Updated middleware to redirect to `/app/nearby` instead of `/app`
- Cleared build cache

## If Still Getting 404

1. **Check the URL** in your browser address bar after sign in
   - Should be: `http://localhost:3000/app/nearby`
   - NOT: `http://localhost:3000/app`

2. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console):
   - Look for any red errors
   - Share them with me

3. **Try direct URL**: http://localhost:3000/app/nearby
   - If this works, the routing is fine - it's just the redirect

**After restarting the server, try signing in again!**
